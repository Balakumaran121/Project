# Full Stack Todo Project (MERN)

A Full Stack Todo Project using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) is a web application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. It includes features such as editing, deleting, and viewing tasks. The project follows the MERN stack, which consists of:

- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database to store tasks
- **Express.js** – Backend framework for handling API requests
- **React.js** – Frontend framework for building the user interface
- **Node.js** – Runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server

---

## Features

✅ User Authentication (JWT-based login & signup)  
✅ Add, Edit, Delete Todos  
✅ Store Todos in Database (MongoDB)  
✅ Responsive UI with React & Tailwind CSS  
✅ Backend API with Express & Node.js  
✅ State Management with Zustand

## Project Structure

### Frontend (React.js)
- Using React Hooks
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- API requests using Axios

### Backend (Node.js & Express.js)
- Express.js to create RESTful APIs
- MongoDB + Mongoose for database interactions
- JWT Authentication for user sessions
- bcrypt.js for password hashing
